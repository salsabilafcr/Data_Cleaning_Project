# FIFA21_Dataset_Cleaning_With_Python

The FIFA21 dataset used in this project was obtained from the public dataset. This data consists of player attributes, statistics and other relevant information.
The original FIFA21 dataset contains over 18,000 player data records. Each record represents a unique player and includes various attributes such as player name, age, nationality, club, overall ranking and more.

### Issues Found in The Data
During the initial exploration and analysis of the FIFA21 dataset, several issues were identified including:
- Missing values - The Hits and Loan Date End columns had missing values which required careful handling and computation.
- Inconsistent formatting - This was seen in some columns that had varying and inconsistent values, hence the need to standardize the data. There are also some columns that have different unit formats.

## Tools Used
For the data cleaning project, the following tools and libraries were used:
- **Python**Â for data cleaning tasks.
- **Pandas Library** for instrumental in data manipulation, cleaning and handling missing values.
- **NumPy Library** for utilized for mathematical operations and array handling during the cleaning process.
- **Jupyter Notebooks** provided an interactive environment for code development, exploration and documentation.
